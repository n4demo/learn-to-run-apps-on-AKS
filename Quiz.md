## Learn to run containerised applications on AKS - Quiz

1. When running Kubectl, where are the credentials stored that enable access to the Kubernetes cluster?

2. If I create a deployment yaml file and then apply it to the cluster and it creates a pod: nginx-123-344-56. What will happen if I use the AKS dashboard, select this POD and delete it?

3. I need to deploy three micro-service based apps into AKS and I want to follow best practice. After I have completed this task, how many yaml files should end up being stored in my source control repository? Name them.
